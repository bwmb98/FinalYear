        <div class="bkl" *ngIf="disease == 'Benign Keratosis'">
            <p>A Benign keratosis is a common
                noncancerous skin growth. People tend to get more of them as they get older. <br><br>

                Benign keratoses are usually brown, black or light tan. The growths look waxy, scaly and slightly
                raised. They usually appear on the head, neck, chest or back. <br><br>

                Benign keratoses are harmless and not contagious. They don't need treatment, but you may decide to
                have them removed if they become irritated by clothing or you don't like how they look. <br></p>

            <h6><b>Symptoms</b></h6><br>
            A benign keratosis usually looks like a waxy or wartlike growth. It typically appears on the face, chest,
            shoulders or back. You may develop a single growth, though multiple growths are more common. <br><br>

            <b> A benign keratosis:</b>

            <ul>
                <li> Ranges in color from light tan to brown or black</li>
                <li> Is round or oval shaped</li>
                <li> Has a characteristic "pasted on" look</li>
                <li>Is flat or slightly raised with a scaly surface</li>
                <li>Ranges in size from very small to more than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) across</li>
                <li> May itch</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="akiec" *ngIf="disease == 'Actinic Keratoses'">
            <p>An actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly
                patch on the skin that develops from years of sun exposure. It's often found on the face, lips, ears,
                forearms, scalp, neck or back of the hands.<br><br>

                Also known as a solar keratosis, an actinic keratosis grows slowly and usually first appears in people
                over 40. You can reduce your risk of this skin condition by minimizing your sun exposure and protecting
                your skin from ultraviolet (UV) rays.<br><br>

                Left untreated, the risk of actinic keratoses turning into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell
                carcinoma is about 5% to 10%.</p>
            <h6><b>Symptoms</b></h6>
            Actinic keratoses vary in appearance. <br><br>
            <b>Signs and symptoms include:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Rough, dry or scaly patch of skin, usually less than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter</li>
                <li>Flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin</li>
                <li>In some cases, a hard, wartlike surface</li>
                <li>Color variations, including pink, red or brown</li>
                <li>Itching, burning, bleeding or crusting</li>
                <li>New patches or bumps on sun-exposed areas of the head, neck, hands and forearms</li>

        <div class="nv" *ngIf="disease == 'Melanocytic Nevi'">
            <p>A melanocytic naevus (American spelling ‘nevus’), or mole, is a
                common benign skin lesion due to a local proliferation of pigment cells (melanocytes). It is sometimes
                called a naevocytic naevus or just 'naevus' (but note that there are other types of naevi). A brown or
                black melanocytic naevus contains the pigment melanin, so may also be called a pigmented naevus.
                <br><br>

                A melanocytic naevus can be present at birth (a congenital melanocytic naevus) or appear later (an
                acquired naevus). There are various kinds of congenital and acquired melanocytic naevi (American
                spelling 'nevi').
            </p>
            <h6><b>Clinical features of melanocytic nevi</b></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>They may arise on any part of the body.</li>
                <li>They differ in appearance depending on the body site.</li>
                <li>They may be flat or protruding.</li>
                <li>Light-skinned individuals tend to have light-coloured naevi and dark-skinned individuals tend to
                    have dark brown or black naevi.</li>
                <li>They vary in colour from pink or flesh tones to dark brown, steel blue, or black.</li>
                <li>Although mostly round or oval in shape, moles are sometimes unusual shapes.</li>
                <li>They range in size from a couple of millimetres to several centimetres in diameter.</li>

        <div class="bcc" *ngIf="disease == 'Basal cell carcinoma'">
            <p>Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell
                carcinoma begins in the basal cells — a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old
                ones die off.<br><br>

                Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other
                forms. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as
                your head and neck.<br><br>

                Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation
                from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma.
            </p>
            <h6><b>Symptoms</b></h6>
            Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less
            often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the
            genitals.<br><br>

            Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. These
            changes in the skin (lesions) usually have one of the following characteristics:
            <ul>
                <li><b>A shiny, skin-colored bump</b> that's translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface.
                    The bump can look pearly white or pink on white skin. On brown and Black skin, the bump often looks
                    brown or glossy black. Tiny blood vessels might be visible, though they may be difficult to see on
                    brown and Black skin. The bump may bleed and scab over.</li>
                <li><b>A brown, black or blue lesion —</b> or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised,
                    translucent border.</li>
                <li><b>A flat, scaly patch</b> with a raised edge. Over time, these patches can grow quite large.</li>
                <li> <b> A white, waxy, scar-like lesion </b>without a clearly defined border.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="vasc" *ngIf="disease == 'Vascular Skin Lesion'">
            <p>Vascular lesions are relatively common abnormalities of the
                skin and underlying tissues, more commonly known as birthmarks. There are three major categories of
                vascular lesions: Hemangiomas, Vascular Malformations, and Pyogenic Granulomas. While these birthmarks
                can look similar at times, they each vary in terms of origin and necessary treatment.</p>
            <h6><b>Complications</b></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Local complications include ulceration, bleeding, and infection. Most bleeding can be controlled by
                    simple pressure. Superficial infection can be treated with topical antibiotic ointment and
                    non-adhering dressings. Lesions in the anogenital area are often difficult to treat and laser
                    therapy may be indicated. </li>
                <li>Hemangiomas in vital areas may need special treatment, especially those around the eyes that may
                    affect vision and lead to amblyopia. There may be lesions in the airway that cause respiratory
                    compromise and others may interfere with defecation and feeding.</li>
                <li>Kasbach-Merritt syndrome is characterized by rapid growth of hemangiomas associated with
                    thrombocytopenia and bleeding secondary to platelet trapping and consumption coagulopathy.</li>
                <li>Disseminated neonatal hemangiomatosis - multiple skin lesions and also may have visceral hemangiomas
                    that can lead to high output cardiac failure and bleeding</li>
                <li>Residua post regression - may have hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, scarring, and redundant skin
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h6><b>Treatment</b></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Reassure - Explain the natural course of the hemangiomas.</li>
                <li>Encourage families to take pictures to document either progression or involution of lesions.
                    Comparison films help in deciding whether treatment is necessary or has been effective.</li>
                <li>If lesions are very large, growing very rapidly, interfering with vital functions, in areas that are
                    constantly irritated, or associated with bleeding disorder or heart failure, referral to a pediatric
                    dermatologist is recommended.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="mel" *ngIf="disease == 'Melanoma'">
            <p>Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells
                (melanocytes) that produce melanin — the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form
                in your eyes and, rarely, inside your body, such as in your nose or throat.<br><br>

                The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight
                or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma. Limiting your exposure to UV
                radiation can help reduce your risk of melanoma.<br><br>

                The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the warning
                signs of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer
                has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is detected early.</p>
            <h6><b>Symptoms</b></h6>
            <p>Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to
                the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face.<br><br>

                Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet,
                palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker
                skin.<br><br>
                The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A change in an existing mole</li>
                <li>The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin</li>
            </ul>
            <h6><b>Treatment</b></h6>
            <p>While melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer, promising new treatment options are
                improving quality of life and increasing survival rates for patients with advanced melanoma.<br><br>

                If you’ve been diagnosed, your treatment choices depend on the stage of the disease, the location of the
                tumor and your overall health. Options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surgical removal of the melanoma</li>
                <li>Immunotherapy</li>
                <li>Targeted therapy</li>
                <li>Chemotherapy</li>
                <li>Radiation</li>

        <div class="df" *ngIf="disease == 'Dermatofibroma'">
            <p>Dermatofibroma (superficial benign fibrous histiocytoma) is a common
                cutaneous nodule of unknown etiology that occurs more often in women. Dermatofibroma frequently develops
                on the extremities (mostly the lower legs) and is usually asymptomatic, although pruritus and tenderness
                can be present. It is actually the most common painful skin tumor. A number of well-described,
                histologic subtypes of dermatofibroma have been reported. Removal of the tumor is usually not typically
                required unless diagnostic uncertainty exists or particularly troubling symptoms are present.</p>
            <h6><b>Symptoms and Complications</b></h6>
            <p>Dermatofibromas tend to grow slowly. The growths typically have some defining characteristics that can
                aid their identification.
                <br>
                Key markers of a dermatofibroma are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Appearance:</b> A dermatofibroma presents as a round bump that is mostly under the skin.</li>
                <li><b>Size:</b> The normal range is about 0.5–1.5 centimeters (cm), with most lesions being 0.7–1.0 cm
                    in diameter. The size will usually remain stable.</li>
                <li><b>Color:</b> The growths vary in color among individuals but will generally be pink, red, gray,
                    brown,
                    or black.
                <li> <b> Location:</b> Dermatofibromas are most common on the legs, but they sometimes appear on the
                    arms,
                    trunk, and, less commonly, elsewhere on the body.</li>
                <li> <b> Additional symptoms:</b> Although they are usually harmless and painless, these growths may
                    occasionally be itchy, tender, painful, or inflamed.</li>
            </ul>
